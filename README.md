## Developer Experience

This was my second time creating a website for a real company, and my first time creating a website for a friend. I really enjoyed helping bring someone's vision to life and contributing to the founding of their company. I always enjoy working on MERN applications and working with state variables, and I got to play around with writing script for requiring the user to accept the terms and conditions and creating alerts for/requiring numbers for certain form fields.
